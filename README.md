***#About***

This is a simple project which includes the html and php to be hosted and a python program that requests for the commands from the server and executes it as a shell command.(000webhost is free so that's what I use)

**#Usage**
Change the URL in the /Client/Botnet.py to the text file hosted by you
Get the target to open your python file (Somehow)
Enter the commands at /Server/index.html

**Tips**

Change permissions for the php and text to 777

**HELP NEEDED**

This is the very basic framework. Please fork and contribute.

*Help needed on:*

1. Modules such as taking screenshots and stuff.
2. Send identification data back to the server
3. Send shell output back to server
